## Project Planning

This project was assigned to us at the beginning of our construction week. After analyzing the project requirements, each team member took responsibility for one of the three main sections. We worked independently on our assigned sections and created daily branches to commit and push our work. Collaboration was smooth, and at the end, we merged the final code into the main branch, successfully completing the project.
